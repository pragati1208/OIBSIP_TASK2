            But he was learning so fast, that daddy needed to hire a professional developer to tutor him. David Newman was the man, who was given the task to mentor the young Mark.
            It was a tough task for the teacher, because the student was developing his skills so quickly, that Newman experienced serious difficulties to stay ahead of him.
            At high school Mark excelled in his classes he won prizes in astronomy, physics, and mathematics. While he was still in high school, he took a college graduate program in computer programming.
